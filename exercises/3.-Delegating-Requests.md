## Use Case: Value Lists

In this exercise, you will make a new `Customers` entity available, so that the user can pick customer data in a value list.

## Expose `Customers` in service

Create a new file `srv/mashup.cds` and add this snippet, so that `Customers` appears in the API of the `IncidentsService`:

```cds
using { sap.capire.incidents, IncidentsService } from './incidents-service';
using { s4 } from './external';

extend service IncidentsService with {
  entity Customers as projection on s4.simple.Customers;
}
```

Also in the same file, add an association from `Incidents` to `Customers`:

```cds
extend incidents.Incidents with {
  customer : Association to s4.simple.Customers;
}
```

## Delegate calls to remote system

To make the value help for `Customers` work, we need to redirect the request to the remote system (or our mock).
Otherwise, the framework would read it from a local DB table, which does not exist.

So, in file `srv/incidents-service.js`, add this snippet in method _init_ before the _return_ statement:

```js
  this.on('READ', 'Customers', (req) => this.onCustomerRead(req));
  this.S4bupa = await cds.connect.to('API_BUSINESS_PARTNER');
```

And this snippet before the closing bracket of the class:
```js
  async onCustomerRead(req) {
    console.log('>> delegating to S4 service...');
    return this.S4bupa.run(req.query);
  }
```

## Test with Remote System

As a ready-to-use remote service, we use the sandbox system of SAP Business Accelerator Hub.

> To use your own SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-ext-service-s4hc-use.html). You don't need it for this tutorial though.

1. Create a **new file `.env`** in the root folder of your project and add **environment variables** that hold the URL of the sandbox as well as a personal API Key:

    ```properties
    DEBUG=remote
    cds.requires.API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.[sandbox].credentials.url=https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/
    cds.requires.API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.[sandbox].credentials.headers.APIKey=<Copied API Key>
    ```

    Note the `[sandbox]` segment which denotes a [configuration profile](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env#profiles) named `sandbox`.  The name has no special meaning.  You will see below how to use it.

2. Get an **API key**:

    - Go back to the [Business Partner (A2X) API page](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/).
    - Choose _Show API Key_ on the right.
    - Choose _Copy Key and Close_.

      ![Get API key from SAP Business Accelerator Hub](./assets/hub-api-key.png)

> If you can't authenticate to Business Accelerator Hub, use this token instead: NHvmMff40U6AAIgQ40QOgP9u3bdMiHe2

3. **Add the key** to the `.env` file

    > By putting the key in a separate file, you can exclude it from the Git repository (see the `.gitignore` file).<br>
    >
    > Also note how the `cds.requires.API_BUSINESS_PARTNER` structure in the `.env file` matches to the `package.json` configuration.<br>
    To learn about more configuration options for CAP Node.js applications, see the [documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env).

Now kill the server with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and run again with the profile activated:

```
cds watch --profile sandbox
```

In the server log, you can see that the configuration is effective:
```
...
[cds] - connect to API_BUSINESS_PARTNER > odata-v2 {
  url: 'https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/',
  headers: { APIKey: '...' }
}
...
```

On the application's index page, the **mocked service is gone**, because it is no longer served in the application. Instead, it is assumed to be **running in a remote system**.  Through the configuration above, the system knows how to connect to it.

Open `/incidents/Customers` to see the data coming from the remote system.

> If you get a `401` error instead, check your API key in the `.env` file.  After a change in the configuration, kill the server with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and start it again.

You can also see something like this in the log (due to the `DEBUG=remote` variable from the `.env` file above):

```
[remote] - GET https://.../API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner
  ?$select=BusinessPartner,BusinessPartnerFullName&$inlinecount=allpages&$top=74&$orderby=BusinessPartner%20asc
...
```

This is the remote request sent by the framework when `S4bupa.run(req.query)` is executed.  The **`req.query` object is transparently translated to an OData query** `$select=BusinessPartner,BusinessPartnerFullName&$top=...&$orderby=...`.  The entire HTTP request (completed by the sandbox URL configuration) is then sent to the remote system with the help of **SAP Cloud SDK**.

Note how **simple** the execution of remote queries is.  No manual OData query construction needed, no HTTP client configuration like authentication, no response parsing, error handling, issues like hard-wired host names etc.

> See the [documentation on CQN](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/cds/cqn) for more on such queries in general.  The [service consumption guide](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/guides/using-services#execute-queries) details out how they are translated to remote requests.

## Finish UI

The UI needs some more annotations to show the changed data.

1. Put basic annotations that refer to `Customers` itself in `srv/external/index.cds`, next to the `Customers` definition:

    ```cds
    annotate Customers with @UI.Identification : [{ Value:name }];
    annotate Customers with @cds.odata.valuelist;
    annotate Customers with {
      ID   @title : 'Customer ID';
      name @title : 'Customer Name';
    }
    ```

2. Annotations that refer to `Incidents` or its association to `Customers` should go to file `srv/mashup.cds`.  Add this snippet there:

    ```cds
    // import annotations from rest of the application
    using from '../app/services';

    annotate IncidentsService.Incidents with @(
      UI: {
        // insert table column
        LineItem : [
          ...up to { Value: title },
          { Value: customer_ID, Label: 'Customer' },
          ...
        ],

        // insert customer to field group
        FieldGroup #Details : {
          Data: [
            { Value: customer_ID, Label: 'Customer'},
            ...
          ]
        },
      }
    );
    ```

    > Don't change the ellipsis `...` in the `cds` code above.  It's a special syntax for refering to the 'remaining values' of array-valued annotations.  The advantage of this syntax is that you do not have to repeat the other table columns.  See the [documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#extend-array-annotations) for more.

## Verify in UI

Now Open _Fiori preview_ for the `Incidents` entity.

**Create a new incident** and **select a customer** using the value help. When pressing _Save_, watch the console output of the application and see the `>> delegating to S4 service...` message.


<!-- ## Optional: Improve the error handling

Execute the above requests with a customer ID that does not exist (like `XXX`).

- What error do you get?
- Can you improve the error handling such that the client gets a `404` error instead, including a proper error message? See the [documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/events#req-reject).

<details>
<summary>See the solution</summary>

Make sure to turn the `502` error into a _client_ error like `404`:

```js
if (!replicated) {
  let customer
  try {
    customer = await S4bupa.read(Customers, ID)
  } catch (e) {
    return req.reject(404, 'No such customer: ' + ID, 'customer_ID')
  }
  await INSERT(customer).into(Customers)
}
```

</details>

## Behind the scenes - SAP Cloud SDK

When you integrate data from SAP S/4HANA, CAP applications use the [SAP Cloud SDK](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/) underneath.
It is a set of libraries that reduce the effort of building applications on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

### Connectivity

SAP Cloud SDK abstracts authentication flows and communication with SAP BTPs [connectivity, destination, and XSUAA services](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/connectivity/destination).
It doesn't matter whether you want to connect against Cloud or On-premise systems.

### OData and REST clients

For applications not using CAP, SAP Cloud SDK helps you build your own typed clients for any OData or REST service to easily connect to your and SAP's systems.

<!-- ## Think about it: What would happen in production?

In a productive environment you would delegate to a real SAP S/4HANA system, where you use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Those mechanisms handle sensitive data like passwords and often involve token exchange flows and certificates.
SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) offers the Destination and Connectivity services, to:

- securely store your credentials
- provide all technical information needed to authenticate against a system
- allow connections to On-premise systems through the SAP Cloud Connector

To use a destination in CAP, you would reference it in a new `production` profile in your `package.json`.

```jsonc
"API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
  /* ... */
  "[production]": {
    "credentials": {
      "destination": "S4HANA"
    }
  }
}
``` -->

## Summary

In the next [exercise](4.-Replicating-Data.md), you will use data replication to display local and remote data in a performant way.
