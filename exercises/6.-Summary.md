## What You Have Seen

In the first exercises, you have seen the **basic steps to integrate a remote service** like

- Importing an **API definition**
- **Expose** the remote service
- **Delegate queries** to the remote service
- **Mash up** the remote service with local services
- **Optimize** performance by adding on-demand replication
- **Mock** the remote service for local development

Check out the cookbook about [Consuming Services](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/using-services) for more.

You have also learned about **integration packages**

- How to **build packages** for Node.js
- Which **content types** you can add to them (CDS models, code, etc.)
- About options to **publish** packages
- How to **use packages** in a CAP Node.js application

Check out the [Reuse and Compose](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/extensibility/composition) guide for more.

## How to Continue

You might want to **save your work** so that you can continue later on.  Do this by

- Committing your changes: `git add -A && git commit -m 'Workshop changes'`
- [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository to your personal GitHub account. Then change the remote URL of your local repo accordingly: `git remote set-url origin <ForkURL>`
- Pushing the commits with `git push`

Check out the **complete version** of the application in the `final` branch of the repository: `git checkout final` <br>
This branch:

- Shows you the final stage of the application, plus
- **Augments** the imported BusinessPartner model, e.g. adds missing ON conditions
- Integrates business partner **addresses** on top
