# Bringing Service Integration to Your Fingertips

This repository contains the material for the dCom HandsOn session<br>
_HO001 - Bringing Service Integration to Your Fingertips_.

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to do service integration and event-based data federation with [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap) by using principles of domain-driven design and hexagonal architecture.  Use prebuilt integration packages for common SAP software services, such as business partners in SAP S/4HANA, thus boosting delivery with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.  Learn how SAP Cloud SDK covers connectivity, destinations, and resilience behind the scenes.
